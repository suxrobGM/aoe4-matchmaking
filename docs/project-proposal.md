# **Project Proposal: Developing a Machine Learning-Based Matchmaking System for Age of Empires IV**

## **Introduction**

The advent of online multiplayer games has emphasized the critical role of effective matchmaking systems in ensuring player satisfaction and retention. Age of Empires IV (AoE4), a real-time strategy game, currently relies on the traditional Elo rating system for matchmaking. While the Elo system provides a foundation by considering players' win-loss records, it often falls short in capturing the multifaceted nature of player skills, playstyles, and game dynamics inherent in AoE4. This project aims to develop a matchmaking system using machine learning techniques to create fairer and more engaging matches by leveraging a broader set of player and game features.

## **Problem Statement and Motivation**

The primary problem addressed in this project is the limitation of the existing Elo-based matchmaking system in AoE4. The Elo system does not account for various factors such as individual playstyles, civilization preferences, map dynamics, and other in-game behaviors that significantly influence match outcomes. This can lead to unbalanced matches, reducing player enjoyment and potentially impacting the game's popularity.

The motivation for this project stems from the desire to enhance player experience by creating a more nuanced matchmaking system. By incorporating ML algorithms, we can analyze complex patterns and relationships within the game data, leading to more balanced and competitive matches. This not only benefits players by providing fairer gameplay but also offers the game developers insights into player behaviors and game mechanics, potentially informing future updates and improvements.

## **Specific Machine Learning Tasks**

To achieve the project's objectives, the following ML tasks will be undertaken:

1. **Classification:** Develop predictive models to estimate the probability of a player winning a match against a specific opponent. This involves training classification algorithms using features extracted from pre-game data, such as player MMR (Matchmaking Rating), civilizations chosen, maps played, and input types (keyboard or controller).

2. **Clustering:** Perform player segmentation using clustering algorithms to group players based on similarities in their gameplay characteristics. Features for clustering may include average match duration, win rates, preferred civilizations and maps, and playstyle indicators. This segmentation can enhance matchmaking by pairing players with similar profiles, leading to more enjoyable matches.

## **Datasets to Be Used**

The project will utilize two primary datasets derived from AoE4 game data:

1. **Ranked Games Dataset:** This dataset contains detailed information about individual ranked matches, including game identifiers, timestamps, durations, maps, server locations, and player-specific data such as profile IDs, match results, civilizations used, MMRs, MMR changes, and input types.

2. **Leaderboard Dataset:** This dataset provides player rankings and performance metrics, including ranks, names, profile IDs, ratings, total games played, wins, last game timestamps, and countries.

### **Data Sources and Preprocessing**

The datasets are sourced from in-game data logs and player statistics. Preprocessing steps will include:

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing rank levels, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring data types are appropriate for analysis.

- **Data Integration:** Merging the ranked games and leaderboard datasets to enrich player profiles with additional performance metrics.

- **Feature Encoding:** Converting categorical variables (e.g., civilizations, maps) into numerical formats using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding to facilitate their use in ML algorithms.

- **Normalization and Scaling:** Applying standardization to numerical features to ensure that ML algorithms, particularly those sensitive to feature scales (e.g., K-Means clustering), perform optimally.

## **Potential Challenges, and Biases**

Several challenges and considerations may impact the project's execution and outcomes:

1. **Data Limitations:** The datasets may have limitations in size, diversity, and completeness. A small sample size can affect the statistical power of the analyses and the generalizability of the ML models. Incomplete data or underrepresentation of certain player groups (e.g., players using less common civilizations) may introduce biases.

2. **Biases in Data:** There is a risk of inherent biases in the data influencing the ML models. For example, if certain civilizations are overrepresented among higher-ranked players, the models may incorrectly attribute higher win probabilities to those civilizations, leading to unbalanced matchmaking.

3. **Model Overfitting:** With complex models and limited data, there is a risk of overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data. This undermines the model's utility in real-world matchmaking scenarios.

## **Proposed Methodology**

The project will proceed through the following steps:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Collect and clean the datasets, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables. Merge datasets to create comprehensive player profiles and standardize features for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform EDA to understand the distributions, relationships, and patterns within the data. Visualizations will aid in identifying trends and informing feature engineering.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Develop new features that may enhance model performance, such as win rate, MMR differences, civilization matchup indicators.

4. **Clustering Analysis:** Apply clustering algorithms to segment players into groups based on selected features. Evaluate the clusters for coherence and interpretability, and refine as necessary.

5. **Classification Modeling:** Train classification models to predict match outcomes using the engineered features. Multiple algorithms will be tested, and model selection will be based on performance metrics.

6. **Model Evaluation and Validation:** Use cross-validation techniques and evaluate models using appropriate metrics. Address any overfitting issues and optimize models through hyperparameter tuning.

7. **Simulation and Testing:** Simulate the matchmaking system using historical match data to assess its performance compared to the existing Elo system. Analyze metrics such as match fairness, player satisfaction proxies (e.g., match duration variability), and outcome predictability.

## **Expected Outcomes**

The project is expected to result in:

- A machine learning-based matchmaking system that more accurately predicts fair and balanced matches by considering a wider range of player and game features.

- Enhanced understanding of player behaviors and game dynamics through clustering and EDA, providing valuable insights for game developers.

- A comparative analysis demonstrating the potential advantages of the ML-based system over the traditional Elo system in terms of match fairness and player satisfaction.

## **Conclusion**

This project addresses a significant need in the AoE4 gaming community by proposing an advanced matchmaking system that leverages machine learning to enhance player experience. By incorporating a variety of player and game features into the matchmaking process, the system aims to create more competitive and enjoyable matches. The project's methodology is comprehensive, involving data preprocessing, feature engineering, clustering, classification modeling, and thorough evaluation. Potential challenges have been identified, along with strategies to address them, ensuring the project's feasibility and integrity. The successful implementation of this project could serve as a model for matchmaking systems in other multiplayer games, demonstrating the power of machine learning in improving online gaming experiences.
